Okay so main priorities:
 * Some kind of git integration in editor
   This could just be running the Git commands inside the editor or
   some kind of more window based solution. Either way it needs to be
   super fast and easier than switching to a terminal and typing out the commands.
   Also must include git signs on the left to show what I've changed.
   Also must include ability to run Git blame and find who/when.
 * Probably do the LSP + Mason thing. Must support tsx files fully. Ideally highlighting,
   indenting, etc. Big priorities here are jump to definition keybind.
 * Hotkey to grep entire workspace
 * Hotkey to open telescope and switch to a file
 * Harpoon
 * Set indenting differently per language (per project?)
